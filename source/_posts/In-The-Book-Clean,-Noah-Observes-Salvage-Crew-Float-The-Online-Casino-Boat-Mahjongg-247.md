#  In The Book Clean, Noah Observes Salvage Crew Float The Online Casino Boat Mahjongg 247

The author, Noah, provides a first-hand account of the events that transpired when a salvage crew attempted to float the online casino boat Mahjongg 247.

Earlier this year, a team of salvage experts assembled in Miami with the intention of floating the online casino boat Mahjongg 247. The vessel had been stranded in the middle of Biscayne Bay for years, and its owner had finally given up hope of ever seeing it returned to shore.

The team's plan was deceptively simple: use large inflatable rafts to lift the boat onto the surface of the water, and then use tugboats to guide it back to shore. However, as soon as they began to implement their plan, things went wrong.

The weight of the boat was too much for the rafts to support, and they quickly began to deflate. The crew was forced to abandon their attempt, and the Mahjongg 247 remained stranded in the bay.

This event is documented in Noah's book Clean, which provides a fascinating look at life in Miami.

#  Noah Watches As Salvage Crew Saves Mahjongg 247 Casino Boat

On July 10, 2019, the crew of the salvage tugboat "Wet Willie" succeeded in towing the derelict "Mahjongg 247" casino boat from its watery grave to a secure location near Tampa, Florida. The massive vessel had been abandoned and sunk in 2015 following a major fire.

Noah, who had been anxiously watching from the shoreline, was overjoyed at the sight of the boat being brought back to life. "I can't believe it!" he exclaimed. "After all this time, the Mahjongg 247 is finally going to be saved!"

The 72-year-old casino boat was once a popular destination for tourists in the Tampa area. But after sitting idle and half-submerged for four years, it was in dire need of rescue.

That's where the crew of the Wet Willie came in. Led by Captain Tony Hernandez, they worked tirelessly for two days to bring the Mahjongg 247 back to shore.

"It was a real challenge," said Hernandez. "But we're glad we could finally get it done."

The Mahjongg 247 is now slated for renovation, with plans to reopen it as a new casino boat sometime next year. Noah is already making plans to be one of the first customers!

#  In The Book Clean, Noah Sees Salvage Crew Recovering Mahjongg 247

Noah, watching from the observatory on the 88th floor of the book, saw a salvage crew removing Mahjongg 247 from the building. The mahjongg was covered in soot and grime, but otherwise appeared to be in good condition.

The salvage crew members were careful as they removed the mahjongg, and they placed it carefully on a large cart. They then wheeled it away, heading for the loading dock.

Noah was curious about what had happened to Mahjongg 247. He knew that it was one of the most valuable items in the book, and he was surprised that it had been left behind.

He decided to go down to the loading dock to see what was happening. When he arrived, he saw the mahjongg being loaded onto a truck. He asked one of the crew members what had happened.

The crew member told him that there had been a fire in the building, and that they had been forced to leave Mahjongg 247 behind. Noah was saddened by this news, but he was glad that at least the mahjongg had been recovered safely.
