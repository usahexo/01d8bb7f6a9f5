#  Scores of residents file class action suit over Borges gambling debacle

Residents of the rural town of Borges are up in arms over what they say is a botched gambling initiative by the town's mayor. Scores of residents have filed a class action suit against the mayor and the town council, claiming that they were misled about the scope of the gambling operation and that their economic prospects have been ruined as a result.

In particular, the residents accuse the mayor of engaging in cronyism, awarding exclusive rights to operate the gambling parlor to a friend and political ally, despite objections from other interested parties. The residents also allege that the town council was negligent in its oversight of the project, failing to ensure that proper procedures were followed and that public input was solicited.

The gambling debacle has created tension in Borges, with some residents supporting the mayor and others arguing that he has betrayed their trust. The class action suit is likely to be just the beginning of a long legal battle as both sides prepare for trial.

#  Residents lose homes in Borges' gambling scheme

Thousands of Argentinians have lost their homes in a government-operated gambling scheme allegedly masterminded by presidential candidate and senator, Jorge Fernando "El Borges" Larrivey.

In what has been dubbed the "Larrivey scandal" by the press, it has emerged that the senator used his position as head of the government's gambling authority to manipulate the odds in favour of certain players, causing many private citizens to lose their homes and life savings.

Despite repeated calls for his resignation, Larrivey has so far remained in office and is currently running for president. In response to the scandal, he has claimed that he is the victim of a conspiracy by the media and political rivals.

#  Class action suit filed against Borges over gambling losses

Residents of the state of Maryland have filed a class action lawsuit against Borges, alleging that the company encouraged gambling losses. The suit, which seeks unspecified damages, claims that Borges marketed its services as a way to make money through gambling, but instead caused significant financial harm to those who participated.

“Borges is nothing more than a scam that preyed on our state’s citizens,” said lead counsel for the plaintiffs. “They promised big rewards, but delivered crippling losses. We are asking for justice on behalf of everyone who was harmed by their actions.”

The plaintiffs allege that Borges operated a deceptive and unfair business, and that their tactics caused significant financial harm to many residents of Maryland. They are asking for a jury trial and damages in an amount to be determined.

#  Gambling fiasco forces residents from their homes

A gambling fiasco at a casino in the city suburbs has resulted in many residents being forced from their homes. The casino, which is located in a residential area, has been ordered to close by the state government after it was revealed that staff were rigging slot machines to ensure players kept losing money.

Residents living close to the casino have complained of noise and disruption from the crowds of people who had been visiting the casino since it opened six months ago. Traffic congestion has also been an issue, with cars parking on both sides of the narrow streets near the casino.

The state government said it had no choice but to close the casino after evidence emerged that staff were tampering with slot machines to make them payout less winning tickets. “It’s clear that this place was nothing more than a giant scam,” said a government spokesman. “We’re sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused residents, but our first priority must be to protect them from being scammed like this.”

The casino’s owners have said they are “disappointed” by the decision and hinted at legal action against the state government. They claim that all the machines were tested before they opened and that no evidence of cheating was found.

#  Residents file class action suit over Borges' failed gambling scheme

Residents of the Bronx have filed a class action lawsuit against failed mayoral candidate and current City Councilman Ruben Borges, seeking to recoup the $1.5 million he raised from them in a failed gambling scheme.

Borges, who was crushed in the Democratic primary earlier this year, promised to invest the money in a casino that would bring jobs and revenue to the borough. But the money has yet to be seen, and many residents now find themselves out of pocket.

"He suckered us all," said local resident Carmen Vargas. "I can't even afford to pay my rent now."

The lawsuit, filed by attorney Maurice Grieco, seeks to hold Borges personally liable for the losses suffered by residents. It also seeks an injunction preventing Borges from engaging in any further business dealings in the Bronx.

Borges has refused to comment on the lawsuit, but has previously denied any wrongdoing.
