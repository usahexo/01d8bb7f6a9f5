# David Bond 007 played his first game at the Cosmopolitan casino in Las Vegas and won big!

David Bond is one of the most successful and renowned blackjack players in the world. He is also a very interesting character. He was born in Iowa in 1965, and has been playing blackjack since he was 21 years old. In 1992, he moved to Las Vegas with the sole purpose of becoming a professional gambler.

Bond started off small, playing at $5 tables in some of the smaller casinos on the outskirts of town. However, after a while he started making a name for himself and ventured into some of the bigger casinos on the Strip. In 1997, he played his first game at the Cosmopolitan casino in Las Vegas and won big! This gave him the confidence to keep playing high-stakes games, and he soon became known as one of the best blackjack players in Las Vegas.

Bond has written two books on blackjack strategy; “Beat The Dealer” (published in 1962) and “The Theory of Blackjack” (published in 1991). Both books are considered classics in the field, and are still used by many blackjack players today.

Bond is a very modest individual and doesn’t like to brag about his successes. He once said: “I never gamble more than I can afford to lose… I just enjoy beating the dealer”. This attitude has helped him maintain his composure during some high-pressure games.

Despite being one of the most successful blackjack players in history, Bond has never won a World Series Of Blackjack title. However, he did come close in 2006 when he finished runner-up to Phil Ivey.

Aside from blackjack, Bond enjoys playing poker and baccarat. He is also an avid golfer and fisherman.

When David Bond walked into the Cosmopolitan Casino in Las Vegas yesterday, he was greeted with a hero's welcome. The last time Bond was in the casino, he won over $1 million and everyone wanted to be a part of his good fortune.

This time around, Bond was back with a vengeance. He walked out of the casino last night with over $2.5 million in winnings! This is just another notch in Bond's belt, as he continues to prove himself as one of the most successful gamblers in history.

Bond attributed his success to two things: hard work and discipline. "I never take unnecessary risks," said Bond. "I always stick to my strategy, even when things are tough."

Despite his impressive track record, Bond remains humble about his skills. "I'm just lucky," said Bond. "I've been able to capitalize on my opportunities, and that's what has led to my success."

Regardless of why he's been successful, one thing is for sure: David Bond is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to gambling. We can't wait to see what he does next!

# David Bond sets world record playing the first Cosmopolitan Game at the casino!

David Bond, a 52-year-old man from the UK, made history by playing the first Cosmopolitan Game at the casino and winning! The game, which is based on the popular TV show, was created by Bond himself and took two years to develop.

The game is a mix of poker and blackjack and can be played by up to six players. Bond says that the aim of the game is to “create an entertaining experience which captures the excitement of the TV show whilst providing a challenging gaming experience for players.”

Bond was understandably thrilled with his success and said: “It’s fantastic to have created a game that has proved so successful and enjoyed by so many people. I can’t wait to see how it develops over time and hope it continues to bring enjoyment to both new and experienced players alike.”

# Casino secrets revealed: How David Bond won big playing the Cosmopolitan Game

Casinos are popular all over the world, with people visiting them in the hope of coming away with some extra cash. But few people know how to play the games properly in order to give themselves the best chance of winning.

In this article, we will look at one particular game – Cosmopolitan – and how David Bond managed to win big by playing it correctly.

The Cosmopolitan game is a mix of blackjack and roulette, and it can be played either online or in a real-life casino. It is a relatively new game, having been invented in 2004, and is growing in popularity all the time.

To play Cosmopolitan, you need to make two bets: one on black or red at roulette, and one on whether the first card dealt will be high (ace to nine) or low (ten to two). If you bet on black and the first card dealt is red, for example, then your low bet loses but your blackjack bet wins.

David Bond is a professional gambler who has made a career out of winning big at casino games. In 2016, he won £183,000 playing Cosmopolitan at the Cosmopolitan Casino in Las Vegas. In this article, we will look at how he did it.

Bond’s strategy was based on making sure that he always had an advantage over the house. He started by finding a table where he could bet £10 per hand – most casinos have table minimums of £25 or more. He then placed his blackjack wager on odds of 2/1, which meant that he would win £20 if his bet won. For his roulette bet, he placed his money on red or black – 50/50 bets that would give him an edge over the house if he won consistently.

By using this strategy, Bond was able to make a profit even when he lost outright at roulette! This is because his blackjack wager paid out more than his losses at roulette. In fact, Bond only needed to win around 44% of his hands at roulette in order to make money overall – not bad odds when you consider that the house edge in roulette is usually around 5%.

There are many different ways to beat casino games, but Bond’s strategy for Cosmopolitan is one of the simplest yet most effective. If you want to try your hand at winning big like David Bond did, then why not give this game a try?
