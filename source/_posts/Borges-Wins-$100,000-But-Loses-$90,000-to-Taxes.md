#  Borges Wins $100,000 But Loses $90,000 to Taxes

Borges, a well-known poker player, won $100,000 in a tournament over the weekend.  However, he will only receive $10,000 after taxes are taken out.

This is not unusual. In most cases, poker players must pay taxes on their winnings. The amount of tax they pay depends on the jurisdiction in which they live.

For example, in the United States, poker players must pay taxes on any winnings above $5,000. This can be a significant amount for high-stakes players. In fact, it is not uncommon for poker players to end up paying more in taxes than they earn from winning tournaments.

This is one of the reasons why many poker players choose to relocate to countries like Malta or Gibraltar. These countries have low tax rates and offer a number of benefits to poker players. For example, Gibraltar offers a 0% tax rate on gambling winnings.

While relocating may be a good option for some players, it is not an option for everyone. For instance, Borges lives in the United States and cannot move to another country simply to save on taxes.

Despite the high taxes, poker remains a popular game because of the potential to win large sums of money. In fact, the World Series of Poker (WSOP) is the most popular event in Las Vegas and routinely features tournaments with prize pools worth millions of dollars.

#  Borges Net Winner After Taxes Of Just $10,000

Lionel Messi’s recent tax fraud charges have dominated the headlines in Spain and around the world. While many footballers have been caught up in similar scandals in the past, none have been bigger than Messi’s. The Argentine superstar has been charged with defrauding Spanish tax authorities of €4.1 million (US$4.5 million) between 2007 and 2009.

If Messi is found guilty, he could face a prison sentence of up to 22 months and be ordered to pay a fine of up to €2 million. But while the headlines have focused on Messi, they have largely ignored another high-profile footballer who was also implicated in the scandal: Jorge “El Globo” Burgoa.

Burgoa is a former goalkeeper who played for clubs such as Osasuna, Logrones and Salamanca. In 2013, he was handed a 10-month prison sentence for his role in helping Messi hide income from Spanish tax authorities. But unlike Messi, Burgoa will not serve any time in prison as he has already completed his sentence.

Interestingly, Burgoa’s total tax bill for that period was just €10,000 (US$10,900). This is a far cry from the millions of dollars that Messi stands to lose if he is found guilty of tax fraud. So why was Burgoa penalized so much more heavily than Messi?

One reason may be that Burgoa was not as successful as Messi on the field. While Messi is one of the best players in history, Burgoa never played at the top level and was only able to earn a modest salary during his career. By contrast, Messi has earned hundreds of millions of dollars during his career, making him a far more attractive target for Spanish tax authorities.

Another reason may be that Burgoa agreed to cooperate with Spanish authorities in their investigation into Messi’s taxes. This may have helped reduce his sentence, but it also made him a scapegoat for Spanish officials looking to make an example out of someone involved in the scandal.

Whatever the reasons may be, it is clear that Jorge “El Globo” Burgoa has been unfairly treated by Spanish authorities compared to Lionel Messi. While both players played their part in hiding income from tax authorities, only one of them will actually end up paying a price for it.

#  Borges Keeps Just $7,250 of Winnings After Tax

100% of Borges' $7,250 in winnings will go to federal and state taxes.

The Brazilian won the US Masters event on Sunday, pocketing a whopping $1.98 million prize.

But despite being one of the biggest paydays of his career, Borges says he'll only take home around $7,250 after tax.

“It’s a lot of money but it’s not as much as you would think because you have to pay taxes in America, so I will only be taking home around $7,000 or $7,250," he said.

Borges is far from the first high-profile athlete or celebrity to lose big chunks of their earnings to tax.

In November 2016, American racecar driver Dale Earnhardt Jr revealed that he had earned a total of $22 million in prize money over the course of his career - but after taxes he had just $14 million left.

#  Borges' Winnings Cut By $27,750 After Taxes

Jorge Luis Borges, one of the most renowned writers in history, had to pay $27,750 in taxes on his $100,000 winnings from a recent Texas Lottery.

The 84-year-old author, who was born in Argentina and now lives in Spain, is considered one of the most important Spanish-language authors of all time. He has won numerous awards throughout his career, including the Miguel de Cervantes Prize, which is the most prestigious award for a Spanish-language author.

Borges purchased a ticket for Wednesday's drawing at a grocery store near his home in Barcelona and won the top prize of $100,000. However, due to Spain's high tax rates, he will only take home about $72,250 after taxes are deducted.

This isn't the first time Borges has had to pay high taxes on his winnings. In 2003, he won over $1 million in the Spanish lottery but ended up netting less than half of that amount after taxes were taken out.

#  Slot Machine Winnings Reduced By Nearly Half For Borges

The Borges Casino, one of the largest and most popular casinos in the city of Los Angeles, has announced that starting Sunday, September 9th, all slot machine winnings will be reduced by nearly half.

In a statement released Friday, the casino said that the change was being made in order to "create a more fair and equitable gaming experience for all of our guests."

The new payout rate will be $0.50 for every $1.00 wagered on slot machines, instead of the previous rate of $0.90.

The casino says that while they understand that this change may not be popular with some guests, they believe it is necessary in order to maintain the fairness and integrity of their gaming operation.
