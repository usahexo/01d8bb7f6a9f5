#  What Cards Does the Dealer Hit on in Blackjack - Borges edition

dealer hits on 16 or less, dealer stands on 17 or more.

This classic blackjack rule is simple - the dealer sticks on stiff hands (defined as 12-16) and takes cards on hands of 17 or lower. On hands of 18 or higher, the dealer stands. With this basic information, you can make some strategic decisions about when to hit and stand in blackjack.

For instance, if the dealer shows a 2 and you have an Ace, it's generally wise to hit because the dealer has a high chance of busting (going over 21). However, if you have a hand like an Ace and a 5, you might want to stand because the dealer is likely to have a low card showing and your chances of beating her are slim.

Knowing when to hit and stand is essential for blackjack players - using this guide as a foundation, you can start making informed decisions at the table and increase your chances of winning!

#  Why You Should Always Hit on 16 in Blackjack - According to Borges

Gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time, but it’s important to understand the basics of the games you are playing. Blackjack, for example, is a game that can be mastered with a little bit of practice.

Basics of Blackjack

First, let’s go over the basics of blackjack. In blackjack, the goal is to beat the dealer’s hand total without going over 21. You can achieve this by either getting closer to 21 than the dealer without going over, or by having a higher total than the dealer even if you go over 21.

As you play, you will be given two cards face up and the dealer will be given two cards - one face up and one face down. The face-up card is called the upcard. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. If your first two cards add up to 21, you have a natural and automatically win the hand.

If your first two cards are an Ace and a 10 value card (Jack, Queen or King), this is called a blackjack and it pays out 3:2 odds instead of even money. That means that for every $5 bet, you would receive $7.50 back (3 x $5). So it's always worth hitting on 16 if you have those particular first two cards!

In general, though, if your first two cards total less than 10, you should hit on 16 because drawing another card will probably give you a better chance of not going bust (over 21). If your first two cards total 10 or more, then stand because drawing another card will most likely put you over 21. Of course, these are basic guidelines and you should always use your own judgment based on what the dealer is showing.

One other thing to note: in blackjack, Ace can count as 1 or 11 depending on what else is in your hand. So if you have an Ace and a 6, for example, the Ace would count as 7 because that would make the best possible hand (a total of 21).

#  Borges Reveals the Best Way to Play Blackjack for Maximum Profits

Legendary Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges once penned a guide on how to play blackjack like a pro. While the game of blackjack is not without risk, following Borges’ advice can help players make the most of their chances and walk away with healthy profits.

Borges recommends starting with a modest amount of money- $100 or $200, for example- and only betting one unit per hand. He also advises sticking to conservative betting strategies, such as doubling down on 11 or 12 and splitting pairs of 8s or Aces.

Players should also avoid gambling on longshot hands, such as 21 made up of three or four cards. In general, it’s best to avoid risking large sums of money on any one hand.

By adhering to these basic guidelines, blackjack players can minimize their losses and maximize their profits. With a bit of luck and some careful strategizing, they may even be able to beat the dealer at his own game!

#  What You Need to Know About Card counting with Borges

A lot of people are intimidated by the prospect of learning how to card count, but with a little bit of practice, it's not as difficult as it seems. In this article, we'll go over the basics of card counting and how you can use it to improve your odds at the casino.

The first step in learning how to card count is understanding the different values that each card has. In blackjack, the ace is worth either 1 point or 11 points, depending on what is advantageous for the player. numbered cards are worth their face value, while face cards are worth 10 points each.

Once you understand the value of each card, you need to start keeping track of which cards have been played. This can be done by simply mentally keeping track of which cards have been dealt or by using a tracking system like a pen and paper. As each card is dealt, you'll want to mark down whether it's an ace, a 2-9, a 10 or a face card.

The next step is to start counting the cards. When you're starting out, it's best to just count the high cards (aces and 10s) and low cards (2s through 6s). As each high card is dealt, you'll want to add 1 point to your running total, and as each low card is dealt, you'll want to subtract 1 point from your total. If your total starts getting too high or too low, you can adjust your bets accordingly.

Once you've mastered counting the high and low cards, you can start counting all of the cards in between. This will give you a more accurate reading of the deck and help you make better betting decisions.

Card counting can seem daunting at first, but with a little bit of practice it's easy to learn. By using these basic steps, you can give yourself a better chance of winning at blackjack.
