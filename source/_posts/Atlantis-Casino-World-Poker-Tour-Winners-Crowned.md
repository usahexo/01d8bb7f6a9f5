#  Atlantis Casino Becomes Home to WPT

Atlantis Casino Resort Spa in Reno, Nevada will become the home of the World Poker Tour (WPT) this season. The prestigious poker tour announced the move on Wednesday.

The Atlantis Casino has been a regular stop on the WPT tour for years, but has never served as the tour's homebase. That will change this season, as the casino and its sister property, The Sands Regency, will host a total of six WPT events between now and April 2019.

The first event at the new homebase will be a $1,100 no-limit hold'em tournament that starts on October 17th. Players can expect a $10 million prize pool over the course of the season at Atlantis Casino Resort Spa.

"We are excited to partner with Atlantis Casino Resort Spa and The Sands Regency as our new homebase in Reno," said WPT president Adam Pliska in a press release. "Reno is an important market for us and we are looking forward to bringing our world-class poker experience to players at these two properties."

In addition to the six events at Atlantis Casino Resort Spa, The Sands Regency will also host four additional WPT tournaments. That brings the total number of WPT events being hosted in Reno this season up to 10.

#  Maestro Rockets to Top at Atlantis Casino WPT

Holding out as the last player standing in a field of 1,466 entries, Dmitriy Stukanov became the WPTDeepStacks Atlantic City Main Event Champion and took home $228,240.

The Maestro showed his prowess at the poker table on the final day of play. After starting the day fifth in chips, he eliminated four players to take a commanding chip lead into the six-handed final. He then ousted another player before heads-up play against Andras Koroknai began.

Koroknai gave Stukanov a run for his money but eventually bowed out in second place with $139,940.

This was Stukanov’s first WPT title and it vaulted him up the ranks to become one of Russia’s top tournament players.
