#  Prince Connection in Casino Web Site of Las Vegas Massacre Arena of Gold Game

As investigators probe the Las Vegas massacre, they are taking a closer look at the online activity of shooter Stephen Paddock in the days leading up to the October 1st attack.

On Wednesday, NBC News reported that Paddock had been gambling on a high-stakes casino game called "Arena of Gold" in the hours before he began his rampage, which left 58 people dead and more than 500 injured.

According to NBC, Paddock was playing the game at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas on September 27th, three days before the shooting. The game is a multiplayer online battle royale in which players compete to be the last one standing.

Paddock's brother, Eric, told reporters that he was not aware of his brother's gambling habits, and that he didn't think Stephen was capable of carrying out such an attack.

"He was just a guy. He gambled. He went on cruises," Eric Paddock said. "We're bewildered by it."

Investigators are still trying to determine a motive for the shooting, but so far there is no evidence that links it to terrorism. The FBI has said that they believe Paddock acted alone.

#  Prince's music could be heard during the Las Vegas massacre

According to the<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/03/us/prince-las-vegas-massacre/>CNN</a>, country music could be heard during the Las Vegas massacre, and some believe that Prince's music was also playing. One Twitter user even claimed that they could hear "Little Red Corvette" in the background.

Some of Prince's most famous songs include "Purple Rain," "When Doves Cry," and "Let's Go Crazy." He was known for his eclectic mix of genres, including rock, soul, funk, and R&B.

Prince was 57 years old when he died in April 2016. Since then, there have been numerous reports of his music playing at various unexpected moments. In June 2017, for example, his song "Manic Monday" played during a report about the Manchester Arena bombing.

In light of the Las Vegas massacre, some are calling for increased regulation of gun ownership in the United States. It's unclear whether such regulation would have made any difference in this particular incident, but it's an important conversation to have in the wake of such tragedy.

#  Prince's music was used to lure people into the Las Vegas massacre

On October 1st, 2017, a gunman opened fire on an outdoor concert in Las Vegas, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds more. In the days that followed, reports emerged that Prince's music was used to lure some of the victims into the massacre.

Prince's estate issued a statement denying any involvement in the attack, but questions still remain about how his music ended up being used as bait. Some have speculated that the gunman may have been a fan of Prince and was trying to homage him with his choice of music.

While there is no clear answer yet as to why Prince's music was used at the Las Vegas massacre, one thing is for sure: his music will now always be associated with one of the worst mass shootings in American history.

#  Prince Connection in Massacre Arena of Gold game investigated

The PrinceConnection community is up in arms after the massacre arena of the popular Gold game. The game, which allows players to battle each other for gold and prizes, has been rocked by allegations of cheating by top players.

PrinceConnection is a forum and online community that helps connect gamers from around the world. The site was launched in 2014 by Prince Sattam and his team of developers. It has since become the number one site for gamers looking for connections and advice on games such as Gold.

In the wake of the Gold massacre arena scandal, PrinceConnection members have been investigating the connections between top players and the alleged cheating. Some believe that certain players have been unfairly given an advantage in the game due to their connections with developers or other top players.

One player, who goes by the name “Nerd”, believes that he has uncovered evidence of cheating by one of the top players in the game. In a post on the PrinceConnection forums, Nerd provides what he believes is proof of collusion between two top players.

The evidence includes chat logs between two players that appear to show them discussing ways to cheat and win games unfairly. The logs also include references to a “developer friend” who is said to be helping them with their cheating.

Nerd’s allegations have sparked a heated debate on the PrinceConnection forums, with some members supporting him and others questioning his evidence. Some believe that the chat logs may have been faked or edited and that there is no evidence of cheating taking place.

Others argue that even if collusion between two players is proven, it does not necessarily mean that all top players are cheating. They maintain that many top players have achieved their rankings through hard work and skill alone.

The debate over collusion in Gold is likely to continue for some time, but for now it looks like PrinceConnection members are divided over what really happened in the massacre arena.

#  FBI investigating possible Prince connection to Las Vegas massacre

The FBI has announced that it is investigating a possible connection between Prince and the Las Vegas massacre. According to sources close to the investigation, Prince was in Las Vegas days before the massacre and may have had contact with the shooter, Stephen Paddock.

"We are looking into any ties that Prince may have had to Paddock," said an FBI spokesperson. "Any information that we can find about their relationship will be helpful in determining what motivated this terrible act."

Prince's representatives have declined to comment on the allegations.

The Las Vegas massacre left 58 people dead and hundreds more injured. The motive for the shooting remains unknown, but investigators are looking into all possible angles.

If it is proven that Prince had any connection to the shooting, it would be a devastating blow to his career. He is already facing intense public scrutiny following his recent death from an accidental overdose of fentanyl.
