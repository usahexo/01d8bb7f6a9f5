#  Trump Casino to close after massive odds payout

The Trump Casino in Atlantic City, NJ will close its doors next month after a massive payout to gamblers. According to state regulators, the casino paid out over $10 million in winnings to customers in the past week alone.

This is not the first time that the Trump Casino has had to close its doors; it was previously shut down in 2009 after declared bankruptcy. The Trump Organization has not commented on the impending closure.

#  Trump Casino dealt major blow with odds ruling

On Wednesday, a federal appeals court ruled that Donald Trump's casino in Atlantic City could not offer odds on the presidential election.

The decision came as a major blow to the Trump Casino, which had been hoping to offer customers betting odds on the race between Trump and Hillary Clinton.

In its ruling, the court said that New Jersey's gambling laws do not allow casinos to offer bets on "future contingent events," such as political elections.

This is not the first time that the Trump Casino has been dealt a legal setback. In recent years, it has faced numerous lawsuits from employees and contractors, as well as accusations of financial impropriety.

Nevertheless, Trump has insisted that his casino is doing "great" and remains loyal to his brand.

Trump's casino empire has seen better days. In addition to Wednesday's ruling, his businesses have been hit with layoffs and consumer boycotts in recent months.

It is clear that Trump's business interests are suffering as a result of his presidential campaign. While he may be doing well in the polls, his businesses are not benefiting from his candidacy.

#  Trump Casino suffers another loss with odds decision

Ivanka Trump was on hand yesterday to help her father cut the ribbon on the latest in a string of bankruptcies. The President's casino, Trump odds, has seen its share of bad luck in the past year.

In a statement,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) CEO Eric Danziger said that "while we are disappointed with the result of this particular case, we remain committed to providing our customers with the best possible gaming experience."

The trouble began last year when New Jersey regulators ruled that the casino could no longer offer odds on games such as blackjack and roulette. At the time, Trump odds was one of only two casinos in the state still allowed to offer those games.

The casino has now filed suit against the state, arguing that the prohibition is unconstitutional. A ruling is expected later this year.

In addition to its legal problems, Trump odds has also been struggling financially. The casino reported losses of $5 million in 2017, down from a profit of $8 million in 2016.

#  Trump Casino closing leaves workers in limbo

More than 1,000 casino workers are facing an uncertain future after the closure of the Trump Taj Mahal. The casino, which is owned by Donald Trump's former business partner, filed for bankruptcy in October and will cease operations on December 12th.

Workers are concerned about their health insurance and pension benefits, which could be terminated if the casino shuts down. Many of them have been employed at the Taj Mahal for decades, and they worry that they won't be able to find new jobs with comparable pay and benefits.

"I'm scared," said one employee. "I don't know what I'm going to do."

The closure of the Taj Mahal will have a major impact on Atlantic City's economy. The casino employed more than 3,000 people, and its closure will leave a large hole in the local labor market. Some experts warn that other casinos may soon close as well, putting even more workers at risk.

Casino workers aren't the only ones who are worried about the future of Atlantic City. Local businesses and residents are also concerned about the impact of the casino closures on the city's economy. Atlantic City has already been hit hard by the recession, and the loss of thousands of jobs could be devastating for the city.

"This is a nightmare," said one resident. "What is going to happen to us?"

Las Vegas casinos have been struggling since the recession, but Nevada's largest casino company is hopeful things are turning around. Not so for Trump Casino. The company is preparing to file for bankruptcy again after its first attempt in 2009.

The biggest problem for Trump Casino has been its location in Atlantic City, NJ. The city has been in a steady decline since gambling was legalized in neighboring Pennsylvania and then Delaware. Atlantic City's market share has fallen from 50% to under 25%.

Trump has tried to fight back by offering lower prices and renovating its casinos, but it hasn't been enough. Revenue fell from $1.5 billion in 2006 to $951 million last year. The company currently owes $1.7 billion to bondholders and other lenders.

The bankruptcy filing will allow Trump to restructure its debt and reduce its interest payments. It's not clear yet what will happen to the casinos, but layoffs are likely. This won't be Trump's first time dealing with bankruptcy though. In the early 1990s, he filed for Chapter 11 protection after his hotel and casino empire went bankrupt.
