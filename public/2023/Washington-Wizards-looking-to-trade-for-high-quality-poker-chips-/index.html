        <h1 id="Washington-Wizards-looking-to-trade-for-high-quality-poker-chips"><a href="#Washington-Wizards-looking-to-trade-for-high-quality-poker-chips" class="headerlink" title="Washington Wizards looking to trade for high-quality poker chips"></a>Washington Wizards looking to trade for high-quality poker chips</h1><p>The Washington Wizards are looking to trade for high-quality poker chips, according to league sources.</p>
<p>The Wizards are hoping to bolster their chances of making a deep run in the playoffs this season. In order to do that, they feel like they need to upgrade their chip stack.</p>
<p>“We’re targeting the best chips out there,” said Washington GM Ernie Grunfeld. “We want to be a contender, and we feel like this is the move we need to make.”</p>
<p>The Wizards are reportedly eyeing chips from the likes of the Golden State Warriors, Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics. They believe that by acquiring some of the top poker chips in the league, they will be able to compete with those teams.</p>
<p>So far, the Wizards have been unsuccessful in their efforts to trade for high-quality poker chips. However, they remain hopeful that they will be able to get a deal done before the deadline expires.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Wizards-searching-for-new-poker-chip-supplier"><a href="#Washington-Wizards-searching-for-new-poker-chip-supplier" class="headerlink" title="Washington Wizards searching for new poker chip supplier"></a>Washington Wizards searching for new poker chip supplier</h1><p>Washington Wizards are in search for a new poker chip supplier after their old one, Nevada Gaming Supply, ceased operations. The Nevada-based company shut down all of its operations this past weekend.</p>
<p>This leaves the Wizards with a few weeks to find a new supplier before their home opener against the Miami Heat on October 18th. Team President Ernie Grunfeld said in a statement that the team is “currently exploring our options” and that they are “confident we will find a reliable and quality supplier in time for our home opener.”</p>
<p>Nevada Gaming Supply had been providing poker chips to the team since 2007. The company’s closure comes as a surprise to many, as it was one of the largest suppliers of gaming products in the United States.</p>
<p>The Wizards are not the only team affected by this closure. The Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers, and Miami Heat are also without a poker chip supplier just days before their season opener. It is unclear at this time who will be able to fill the void left by Nevada Gaming Supply.</p>
<h1 id="Report-Washington-Wizards-to-use-poker-chips-in-upcoming-season"><a href="#Report-Washington-Wizards-to-use-poker-chips-in-upcoming-season" class="headerlink" title="Report: Washington Wizards to use poker chips in upcoming season"></a>Report: Washington Wizards to use poker chips in upcoming season</h1><p>The Washington Wizards will be using poker chips to represent the value of each players’ salary during the upcoming season. This is a new strategy that team owner Ted Leonsis came up with in order to “amplify the players’ sense of ownership and responsibility.” </p>
<p>Each chip will have a different color and value, starting with $1,000 for the minimum salary players and going up to $25,000 for the max salaried players. The team will also have “dual currency” which consists of both chips and U.S. dollars. This will allow players to cash in their chips at any time for real money, but they will only be able to spend them at the team’s casino partner, MGM National Harbor. </p>
<p>Leonsis believes that this new system will help the players take more pride in their work and make them feel more invested in the team. He also thinks that it will help create a closer bond between the players and fans. Several NBA teams have already implemented similar systems, but Washington will be the first team in the league to use poker chips as currency. </p>
<p>So far, the reaction from both players and fans has been mixed. Some people believe that it’s a creative way to increase excitement around the team, while others think that it’s just a gimmick that won’t actually achieve anything. The Wizards will be putting this system to the test when they start their preseason games on October 3rd.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Wizards-exploring-new-poker-chip-technology"><a href="#Washington-Wizards-exploring-new-poker-chip-technology" class="headerlink" title="Washington Wizards exploring new poker chip technology"></a>Washington Wizards exploring new poker chip technology</h1><p>The Washington Wizards, one of the most storied franchises in the NBA, are exploring new poker chip technology to improve their odds on the court.</p>
<p>The Wizards are coming off a disappointing season in which they failed to make the playoffs. Team officials believe that the new poker chip technology can help them turn things around.</p>
<p>The new technology is based on a modified version of the 4-3-2-1 poker chip rotation system developed by former NBA coach Stan Van Gundy. Under this system, each player is given four chips at the beginning of the game. The first player to use all four of his chips is out of the game.</p>
<p>This system has proven successful in other sports leagues, and team officials believe that it can work in the NBA as well.</p>
<h1 id="NBA-Poker-Chips-Washington-Wizards-Edition"><a href="#NBA-Poker-Chips-Washington-Wizards-Edition" class="headerlink" title="NBA Poker Chips: Washington Wizards Edition"></a>NBA Poker Chips: Washington Wizards Edition</h1><p>The Washington Wizards have been one of the most puzzling teams in the NBA this season. They started off the year hot, but have since cooled off and find themselves in somewhat of a slump.</p>
<p>One thing that has remained consistent for Washington this season, however, is their strong play at home. They are currently 14-4 at the Verizon Center, which is good for third in the Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>Their home-court advantage is something that opposing teams need to take into account when facing Washington. One way to help offset Washington’s advantage is to try and take away their poker chips—in other words, their best players.</p>
<p>If an opponent can make things difficult for John Wall, Bradley Beal, Otto Porter Jr., and Marcin Gortat, they will likely have a good chance at winning the game. However, if those players are able to get going offensively, things could get out of hand quickly.</p>
<p>Wall is the heart and soul of this Washington team. He leads the Wizards in scoring (22.3 ppg) and assists (10.5 apg), and is also averaging 5.0 rebounds per game. He’s been especially good at home this season, averaging 26.2 points and 11.8 assists per game in Washington.</p>
<p>Beal has also been playing well lately, averaging 22.7 points over his last 10 games. Porter Jr., meanwhile, is fourth on the team in scoring (13.7 ppg) and leads Washington in 3-point percentage (46.3%). Gortat isn’t necessarily known for his offensive prowess, but he’s still putting up solid numbers this season (12.9 ppg, 9.8 rpg).</p>
<p>If an opponent can find a way to slow down Wall and Beal while forcing Porter Jr. and Gortat to contribute more offensively than they’re accustomed to, they’ll be in a good position to come away with a winnable game on the road against Washington</p>
