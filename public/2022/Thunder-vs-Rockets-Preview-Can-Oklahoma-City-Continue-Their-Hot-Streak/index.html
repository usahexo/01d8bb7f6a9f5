        <h1 id="Thunder-vs-Rockets-Preview-Can-Oklahoma-City-Continue-Their-Hot-Streak"><a href="#Thunder-vs-Rockets-Preview-Can-Oklahoma-City-Continue-Their-Hot-Streak" class="headerlink" title="Thunder vs Rockets Preview: Can Oklahoma City Continue Their Hot Streak?"></a>Thunder vs Rockets Preview: Can Oklahoma City Continue Their Hot Streak?</h1><p>The Oklahoma City Thunder have been on a hot streak as of late, winning their last six games. This week, they will be facing off against the Houston Rockets, who have also been playing well recently.</p>
<p>Oklahoma City has been led by their MVP candidate, Russell Westbrook. Westbrook is averaging a triple double this season, and he has continued to play at an extremely high level. He has averaged 30 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists over his last three games. In addition to Westbrook, the Thunder also have several other players who can score and rebound, including Paul George and Carmelo Anthony.</p>
<p>Houston has been led by James Harden this season. Harden is averaging 29 points per game and has been one of the most dominant players in the league. In addition to Harden, the Rockets also have Chris Paul and Clint Capela, who are both playing very well this year.</p>
<p>This matchup should be a very exciting one. These two teams are evenly matched and both have several players who can take over the game. It will be interesting to see which team can come out on top in this matchup.</p>
<h1 id="3-Keys-To-Victory-For-The-Oklahoma-City-Thunder"><a href="#3-Keys-To-Victory-For-The-Oklahoma-City-Thunder" class="headerlink" title="3 Keys To Victory For The Oklahoma City Thunder"></a>3 Keys To Victory For The Oklahoma City Thunder</h1><p>In their game against the Golden State Warriors, the Oklahoma City Thunder have a lot of work to do in order to come out on top. Here are three keys to victory for the Thunder in that matchup.</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep It Tight In The First Quarter</li>
</ol>
<p>The Thunder cannot afford to fall behind early in this game. They need to come out and play with intensity right from the start. If they can keep it close in the first quarter, it will put pressure on the Warriors and make them play catch-up.</p>
<p>2)Control The Glass</p>
<p>The Thunder need to dominate the boards in this game. They are a much stronger team than the Warriors when it comes to rebounding, so they should be able to pull away if they can control the glass.</p>
<p>3)Get Kevin Durant Involved Early</p>
<p>Durant is the best player on the Thunder and they need him to be aggressive early in this game. If he can get going early, it will open up things for his teammates and make it difficult for the Warriors defense.</p>
<h1 id="Can-The-Oklahoma-City-Thunder-Keep-Their-Playoff-Hopes-Alive"><a href="#Can-The-Oklahoma-City-Thunder-Keep-Their-Playoff-Hopes-Alive" class="headerlink" title="Can The Oklahoma City Thunder Keep Their Playoff Hopes Alive?"></a>Can The Oklahoma City Thunder Keep Their Playoff Hopes Alive?</h1><p>The Oklahoma City Thunder have had a disappointing season so far. They are currently in ninth place in the Western Conference with a record of 18-23. If they want to make the playoffs, they will need to improve their record significantly.</p>
<p>Some people are beginning to doubt whether the Thunder can make a comeback this season. However, there is still plenty of time for them to turn things around. Here are three reasons why the Thunder can keep their playoff hopes alive.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Eastern Conference is Struggling</li>
</ol>
<p>The Thunder are not that far behind the eighth-placed team in the Western Conference. The Eastern Conference is much weaker than the Western Conference, so the Thunder could easily move up in the standings if they play well.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Thunder Have a Good Team Chemistry</li>
</ol>
<p>The Thunder have had some issues this season, but they have always been able to overcome them because of their strong team chemistry. This could help them make a comeback this season.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Thunder Have Some Good Players</li>
</ol>
<p>The Thunder have some good players who can lead them to victory if they are playing well. Russell Westbrook, Paul George, and Steven Adams are all playing at a high level right now and could lead the team to a playoff berth.</p>
<h1 id="Oklahoma-City-Thunder-Championship-Contenders"><a href="#Oklahoma-City-Thunder-Championship-Contenders" class="headerlink" title="Oklahoma City Thunder: Championship Contenders?"></a>Oklahoma City Thunder: Championship Contenders?</h1><p>The Oklahoma City Thunder had an up and down season in 2017-2018. They started off the season losing their first six games, but made a comeback and finished the season with a record of 48-34. Despite their average season, they were still able to make it to the playoffs. playoff. In the first round of the playoffs, they played against the Utah Jazz and won in 5 games. In the second round of the playoffs, they played against the Houston Rockets and lost in 7 games.</p>
<p>Despite their early exit from the playoffs, many people believe that the Oklahoma City Thunder are championship contenders for next season. This is because they have one of the best players in the league on their team, Russell Westbrook. Westbrook was able to win MVP last year, and he is expected to have another great year next season. With Westbrook on their team, the Oklahoma City Thunder have a good chance at winning a championship.</p>
<p>Another reason why people believe that the Oklahoma City Thunder are championship contenders is because they have a great coach. Coach Billy Donovan has been able to lead the team to success in his two years with them. He knows how to get the most out of his players and has a lot of experience coaching in playoffs games.</p>
<p>Despite all of this, there are some things that could hold them back from winning a championship next season. One thing is that they do not have much depth on their bench. Another thing is that they will be competing against teams like Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets, who are also considered to be championship contenders.</p>
<p>Even though there are some things that could hold them back, the Oklahoma City Thunder definitely have what it takes to win a championship next season. With Westbrook on their team, along with a great coach and decent depth, they have a good chance at making it to the finals and becoming champions.</p>
<h1 id="How-The-Oklahoma-City-Thunder-Can-Win-The-NBA-Finals"><a href="#How-The-Oklahoma-City-Thunder-Can-Win-The-NBA-Finals" class="headerlink" title="How The Oklahoma City Thunder Can Win The NBA Finals"></a>How The Oklahoma City Thunder Can Win The NBA Finals</h1><p>The Oklahoma City Thunder have had a roller coaster ride of a season. From starting off the season as one of the favorites to win the NBA Finals, to having to fight for their playoff lives in the last few weeks of the season, they’ve experienced it all. But they’re still standing, and they still have a chance to win it all.</p>
<p>In order for the Thunder to win the NBA Finals, they’re going to need to play their best basketball. Here are three things that they need to do in order to hoist the Larry O’Brien trophy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant clicking on all cylinders</li>
</ol>
<p>Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant are two of the most talented players in the NBA. When these two are playing well together, the Thunder are almost impossible to beat. However, when they’re not playing well together, they can be beaten fairly easily. In order for the Thunder to win, Westbrook and Durant need to be playing at their best.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Force turnovers and get out in transition</li>
</ol>
<p>The Thunder are at their best when they’re able to get out in transition and run teams off of the court. They’re an incredibly athletic team, and when they can use that athleticism to force turnovers and score easy baskets, it makes them very difficult to beat. If they can do this against the Golden State Warriors, they’ll have a good chance of winning the series.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Play strong defense</li>
</ol>
<p>The Thunder are a good defensive team, and they need to continue playing strong defense if they want to win the NBA Finals. They’ll need to shut down Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson if they want a chance at victory; otherwise, those two could potentially go off for a lot of points in a hurry. If the Thunder can play lockdown defense on Curry and Thompson, they’ll have a good chance at coming out on top.</p>
