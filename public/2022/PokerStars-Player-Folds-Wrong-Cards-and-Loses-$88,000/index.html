        <h1 id="PokerStars-Player-Folds-Wrong-Cards-and-Loses-88-000"><a href="#PokerStars-Player-Folds-Wrong-Cards-and-Loses-88-000" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars Player Folds Wrong Cards and Loses $88,000"></a>PokerStars Player Folds Wrong Cards and Loses $88,000</h1><p>In what is being called one of the worst folds in poker history, a PokerStars player has folded two pairs – eights and queens – only to see the flop come with two more queens, giving his opponent a set.</p>
<p>The hand took place at a $1&#x2F;$2 table, with the blinds at 25&#x2F;50. The player in question, “aaron85”, raised to 125 before the flop. His opponent, “slipperyjim”, called.</p>
<p>The flop came 8♠Q♥Q♦ and aaron85 led out for 300. Slipperyjim called.</p>
<p>The turn was the 2♣ and aaron85 moved all-in for 2,025 total. Slipperyjim called and tabled Q♠J♥6♣ for three of a kind, while aaron85 showed 8♦8♥2♦ for two pair. The river was the 5♦, completing slipperyjim’s quads and sending aaron85 home with an $88,000 loss.</p>
<p>“That’s one of the worst folds I’ve ever seen live,” said one commentator on the Two Plus Two forums. Another simply called it “disgusting”.</p>
<p>It is not clear exactly what went through aaron85’s mind when he made this fold, but it is safe to say that he will not be forgetting it any time soon.</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-Player-Pushes-All-In-with-Two-Unmatched-Fingers"><a href="#PokerStars-Player-Pushes-All-In-with-Two-Unmatched-Fingers" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars Player Pushes All-In with Two Unmatched Fingers"></a>PokerStars Player Pushes All-In with Two Unmatched Fingers</h1><p>Online poker giant PokerStars was thrust into the headlines again this week after one of their players pushed all-in at a table with two unmatched fingers.</p>
<p>The move, while unorthodox, paid off big for the player as they took down the pot with their audacious bluff.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to make a statement,” said the victorious player, who asked not to be named. “I think it’s important to always keep your opponents guessing.”</p>
<p> Poker experts were quick to weigh in on the play, with many praising the player for their creativity and boldness.</p>
<p>“That was an amazing move,” said one pro. “I don’t think I would have had the guts to do that.”</p>
<p>While some were quick to write the move off as a lucky fluke, others believe that we could be seeing more of this type of play in the future.</p>
<p>“This is definitely a sign of things to come in poker,” said another expert. “Players are getting more and more creative, and we’re starting to see some really bizarre moves.”</p>
<h1 id="Russian-Poker-Pro-Accidentally-Folds-Two-Jacks-at-the-Table"><a href="#Russian-Poker-Pro-Accidentally-Folds-Two-Jacks-at-the-Table" class="headerlink" title="Russian Poker Pro Accidentally Folds Two Jacks at the Table"></a>Russian Poker Pro Accidentally Folds Two Jacks at the Table</h1><p>A professional Russian poker player recently made a costly mistake while at the table, folding two Jacks. After the hand was revealed, he discovered that he could have potentially won the pot if he had held out.</p>
<p>The miscue happened during a tournament in Russia, where the stakes were high and everyone was playing to win. Unfortunately for this particular player, his decision to fold cost him a chance at taking first place and a substantial payday.</p>
<p>While it’s impossible to know exactly what would have happened if he had held out, the odds would have been in his favor. The chances of someone holding two Jacks are about 1 in 21, so it’s likely that he would have won the pot if he had waited.</p>
<p>This mistake is just one example of how even the most experienced players can make mistakes under pressure. In fact, even the best players in the world sometimes make bad decisions that end up costing them dearly.</p>
<p>So don’t feel bad if you make a mistake while playing poker – it happens to everyone. Just remember to stay calm and focus on making smart choices going forward.</p>
<h1 id="Amateur-Poker-Player-Folds-Ace-Queen-After-Realizing-He’s-in-Bad-Position"><a href="#Amateur-Poker-Player-Folds-Ace-Queen-After-Realizing-He’s-in-Bad-Position" class="headerlink" title="Amateur Poker Player Folds Ace-Queen After Realizing He’s in Bad Position"></a>Amateur Poker Player Folds Ace-Queen After Realizing He’s in Bad Position</h1><p>An amateur poker player playing in a high stakes game made a costly folding error this week.  The player, who wishes to remain anonymous, was dealt Ace-Queen offsuit in early position. Looking down at the table and seeing several weak players and one other Ace, the player decided to raise the minimum to try and take down the pot. The big blind quickly called, as did the two players to his left.</p>
<p>The flop came down 4-8-2 rainbow, giving no one any help. The big blind checked, as did the preflop raiser. The player on the button then put in a large bet, trying to represent a strong hand. The big blind folded, but the other two players called.</p>
<p>The turn was a Queen, making the pot very dangerous for the preflop raiser if he was only holding an Ace. Fearing that he may have been beaten, he folded his hand, only to realize after the fact that he would have had top pair with top kicker and could have easily taken down the pot.</p>
<p>This is just one example of how important it is to know when to fold in poker. In general, you should always fold if you don’t have anything close to top pair or better. There are times when it’s okay to call or even raise with weaker hands, but this should be done sparingly and only when you’re sure that your opponent doesn’t have a better hand than you do.</p>
<h1 id="College-Student-Loses-88-Playing-Poker-With-Only-His-Fingers"><a href="#College-Student-Loses-88-Playing-Poker-With-Only-His-Fingers" class="headerlink" title="College Student Loses $88 Playing Poker With Only His Fingers"></a>College Student Loses $88 Playing Poker With Only His Fingers</h1><p>College student, Alan, recently lost $88 playing poker with only his fingers.</p>
<p>Alan originally learned how to play poker from his friends, who all play online with real money. After a few practice rounds with them, Alan confidently decided to take his skills to an online casino and try his luck.</p>
<p>In his first game, Alan lasted until there were only two other players left. At this point, he went all in with two aces – and lost to a pair of tens. This early loss didn’t phased him though, and he continued playing.</p>
<p>The next game was also close, but Alan was eventually eliminated by a full house. In his third and final game, Alan got dealt pocket kings and went all in preflop. Unfortunately for him, the other player had pocket queens and managed to make a straight on the river.</p>
<p>With three consecutive losses under his belt, Alan walked away from the table down $88. However, he plans to continue practicing on free online poker sites so that he can be ready to take on live casinos again in the near future.</p>
